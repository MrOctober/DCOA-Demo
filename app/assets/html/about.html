          <p>The District of Columbia Office on Aging develops and carries out a comprehensive and coordinated system of health, education, employment, and social services for the District's older adults (60 years and older), persons living with disabilities (18 to 59 years old), and their caregivers.</p>
          <p>The Office on Aging was created by DC Law 1-24 in 1975 as the District's State and Area Agency on Aging and structured to carry out advocacy, leadership, management, programmatic, and fiscal responsibilities. The Office on Aging oversees the operation of the Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC). The ADRC provides a single, coordinated system of information and access for individuals seeking long-term services and supports. This is accomplished through the provision of unbiased, reliable information, counseling, and service access to older adults (60 years and older), individuals with disabilities (18 to 59 years old), and their caregivers. The ADRC facilitates the acquisition of services individualized to the unique needs and desires expressed by each person.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Additionally, DCOA also funds a Senior Service Network (“Network”) comprised of 20 community-based non-profit and private organizations that operate more than 30 programs that provide direct services to the District's older adult residents. These services are crucial to the Network and support a broad range of legal, nutrition, social, and health services – including adult day care caregiver support services, hospital discharge planning, long-term care options counseling, nursing home transition services, and other additional support services.
